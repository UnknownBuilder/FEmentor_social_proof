### What I learned

Finishing this Frontend mentor challenge took me forever. I couldn't find the time to finish up. It's ok since this is a hobby but unfortunately, I did notice that a lot of things that use to be second nature I had forgotten. That old saying is true: If you don't use it, you'll lose it. 

Didn't learn anything new per se, this was more of a refresher since I haven't coded in HTML and CSS for a while now. God knows that I needed it. 

### Continued development

I came to a realization that I understsand CSS to an acceptable level that I feel confortable creating basic websites using simple HTML and CSS without any issue. I can even fumble my way through some Javascript if needed. Given this, I think it might be time I start using Tailwind for some of the Frontedn Mentor challenges to build up my skills. 

I can't wait to see the difference in workflow from doing basic CSS to using something like Tailwind. From what I hear on YouTube, should increase my productivity quite a bit. 

I'm not all that strong with Javascript yet so I'm going to continue doing plain Javascript when it's required instead of using frameworks or libraries. I really want to appreciate what the frameworks and libraries give me and the only way to do that is to do thing the hard way for a time.
